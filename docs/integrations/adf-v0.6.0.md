# Azure Deployment Framework (ADF) v0.6.0 â€” Integration Overview

> This page mirrors the ADF v0.6.0 release summary so Speckit teams can review the highlights without leaving the workspace. See the [canonical repository release notes](https://github.com/speckit-dev/adf/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for the source of truth.

## Release Highlights

- **Environment contract bundles** â€” ADF now packages baseline infrastructure templates and policy packs in versioned bundles to simplify bootstrapping new environments.
- **Gate-aware pipelines** â€” Built-in orchestrators emit machine-readable gate results (YAML + SARIF) so SpecKit runners can surface actionable failures in the TUI.
- **Incremental deployments** â€” The orchestrator detects drift between releases and generates targeted plans, reducing apply time on large environments.
- **Diagnostics streaming** â€” Structured events stream to stdout/stderr with correlation IDs, allowing SpecKit's run coach to annotate long-running jobs.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Minimum Version | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| SpecKit CLI | v0.8.0 | Required for the new `speckit integrate adf` scaffold command. |
| SpecKit Policy Runtime | v0.5.0 | Needed to evaluate the bundled `foundations` and `security` packs. |
| Azure CLI | 2.61.0 | Ensure the `azure-dev` extension is updated before running `adf up`. |
| Terraform | 1.7.x | Used for infrastructure modules included in the environment bundles. |

## Upgrade Checklist

1. Pull the latest ADF templates:
   ```bash
   git pull https://github.com/speckit-dev/adf.git main
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Update local environment variables with the new secrets schema introduced in `env.defaults.yaml`.
3. Run `adf doctor` to validate provider credentials and required Azure subscriptions.
4. Migrate existing pipelines to consume `adf gate export --format sarif` so SpecKit's forensics view can ingest failures.
5. Regenerate policy baselines with `adf policy build foundations security` to pick up the tightened defaults.

## Breaking or Notable Changes

- Deprecated `adf deploy --preview` in favor of `adf plan` for clearer separation between planning and apply stages.
- The workspace bootstrapper now writes artifacts under `.adf/` instead of `.azure/`. Update ignore files if you previously whitelisted the old directory.
- Gate definitions moved from `gates.yaml` to `gates/*.yaml`, allowing per-gate versioning.
